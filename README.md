DeleteBreakPoints
======================

This Pointwise Glyph script allows the user to easily and quickly delete all
break points on any number of connectors without having to maneuver all the
menus in the Pointwise GUI.

Usage
-----

There are two ways this script may be used:

1. It can be run on pre-selected connectors.

2. Or, if upon execution there are no connectors selected, the script will
   prompt the user to select the desired connectors.

The script exits after deleting break points; i.e. the script does not allow
for the user to delete any more break points.
